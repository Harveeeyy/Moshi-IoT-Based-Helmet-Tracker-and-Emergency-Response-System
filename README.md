# Moshi-IoT-Based-Helmet-Tracker-and-Emergency-Response-System

An innovative IoT-driven solution developed to enhance motorcycle rider safety through real-time GPS tracking, SOS alert functionality, and voice recording integrated within a smart helmet system.



# Project Overview

Moshi is an IoT-based smart helmet system designed to provide increased safety for motorcycle riders. It enables real-time location tracking, emergency response capabilities via an SOS button, and audio recording in critical situations. The system integrates hardware components such as GPS modules, microcontrollers, and a microphone, connected to a mobile application for monitoring and response.

This project was developed in collaboration with Top Drive Driving Institute â€“ Batangas, aiming to assist riders, trainers, and emergency services through enhanced awareness and fast communication during emergencies.
