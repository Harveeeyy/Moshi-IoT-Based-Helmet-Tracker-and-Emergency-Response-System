# 🪖 Moshi-IoT-Based-Helmet-Tracker-and-Emergency-Response-System

A prototype mobile application developed to improve the safety of motorcycle riders by providing real-time location tracking, SOS alerts, and basic system monitoring. This project was created as part of a capstone requirement at Batangas State University in collaboration with Top Drive Driving Institute – Batangas.



# 📱 Project Overview

Moshi is a mobile-based prototype aimed at enhancing motorcycle rider safety by integrating core emergency response features into a companion app. The system supports:

* GPS-based location tracking
* SOS emergency alerts sent through the app
* Device status monitoring synced from the helmet hardware
  
This capstone project represents the initial development phase, focusing on mobile functionality and simulated data from IoT hardware. The system is designed to assist both riders and emergency contacts during critical events by improving communication and response times.

# 🔧 Development Model

We followed the Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), allowing us to build, test, and improve the app in iterative sprints.

### Current Scope (Prototype Phase):

* Mobile app interface and experience

* Firebase setup and integration

* Real-time GPS tracking

* SOS alert simulation

* Audio recording and storage
