# Moshi-IoT-Based-Helmet-Tracker-and-Emergency-Response-System

A prototype mobile application designed to improve the safety of motorcycle riders through real-time location tracking, emergency alerts, and audio recording capabilities — developed as part of a capstone project at Batangas State University.



# Project Overview

Moshi is a prototype mobile application developed for our capstone project titled "Top Drive Driving Institute: Moshi - An IoT-Based Helmet Tracker and Emergency Response System." It aims to enhance the safety of motorcycle riders by providing emergency alert functionality, GPS-based real-time location tracking, and voice recording during critical situations.

This application is the first phase of the capstone, focusing on the mobile-side functionalities. This project was developed in collaboration with Top Drive Driving Institute – Batangas, with the goal of supporting riders, instructors, and emergency responders through faster, smarter mobile-based communication in emergency situations.
