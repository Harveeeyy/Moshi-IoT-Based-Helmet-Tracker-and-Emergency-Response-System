# Moshi-IoT-Based-Helmet-Tracker-and-Emergency-Response-System

An innovative IoT-driven solution developed to enhance motorcycle rider safety through real-time GPS tracking, SOS alert functionality, and voice recording integrated within a smart helmet system.



# Project Overview

Moshi is a mobile application project developed as part of our capstone entitled "Top Drive Driving Institute: Moshi - An IoT-Based Helmet Tracker and Emergency Response System." It is designed to enhance the safety of motorcycle riders by enabling real-time location tracking, emergency response via an SOS button, and voice recording during critical situations. The system integrates essential IoT hardware components such as GPS modules, microcontrollers, and a microphone, which are connected to the mobile application for continuous monitoring and swift emergency response.

This project was developed in collaboration with Top Drive Driving Institute â€“ Batangas, with the goal of supporting riders, instructors, and emergency personnel through improved situational awareness and rapid communication during emergencies.
