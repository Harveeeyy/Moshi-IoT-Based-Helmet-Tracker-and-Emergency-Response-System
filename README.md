# Moshi-IoT-Based-Helmet-Tracker-and-Emergency-Response-System

A prototype mobile application designed to improve the safety of motorcycle riders through real-time location tracking, emergency alerts, and audio recording capabilities — developed as part of a capstone project at Batangas State University.



# Project Overview

Moshi is a mobile application project developed as part of our capstone entitled "Top Drive Driving Institute: Moshi - An IoT-Based Helmet Tracker and Emergency Response System." It is designed to enhance the safety of motorcycle riders by enabling real-time location tracking, emergency response via an SOS button, and voice recording during critical situations. The system integrates essential IoT hardware components such as GPS modules, microcontrollers, and a microphone, which are connected to the mobile application for continuous monitoring and swift emergency response.

This project was developed in collaboration with Top Drive Driving Institute – Batangas, with the goal of supporting riders, instructors, and emergency personnel through improved situational awareness and rapid communication during emergencies.
